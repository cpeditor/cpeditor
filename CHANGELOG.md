### The Portable Version

Now we provide the portable version on Windows. The portable version saves the config file in the same directory as the executable file of CP Editor, instead of the system config directory, and you can run it without installtion.

With the portable version, you can easily store it in something like a USB disk, and the configs are always with you no matter you run it on which machine. However, the file paths in the settings can be broken when you change the machine.

You need to install a Language Server program to enable linting. You can set delay for linting, the path to the Languae Server program and its arguments in the Preferences window. You can set different settings for different languages. Please check the [manual](MANUAL.md) for more information on how to set this up.

## v6.3

### The new Preferences Window!

The old preferences window is not very extendable, which has been a big obstacle to add new features for a long time. In this version, we bring a brand new preferences window for you.

In the new preferences window, the settings are organized well in a tree structure. Now you can save the settings for each page separately, and get warned when you try to leave a page without saving the changes. You can discard the changes on the current page, or restore the settings on the current page to the default. What's more, you can search for a setting and go to the corresponding page easily.

If you want to backup your settings file or do something with it, we have to tell you that it has been moved from the home directory to the config directory (on Linux, from `$HOME` to `$HOME/.config/CP Editor`). But don't worry, we have been working on keeping backward compatibility, so you won't lose your settings when switching from the old version to the new version.

For the developers, now it's extremely easy to add a new setting. So we'll add more settings with some exciting features in the next version.

### Fixed

- Add auto-close for single and double quotes. (#226)
