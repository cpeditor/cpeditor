## UNRELEASED

### Added

- You can show/hide each testcase, and only run the non-hidden testcases.
- Add a drop-down menu for each testcase. You can delete a testcase / run a single testcase from it.
- Add a drop-down menu for testcases. You can remove empty, remove all, hide AC, show all, hide all, inverse hide/show from it.

### Changed

- The "Hide AC" button is removed. (But a similiar action is added in the "More" menu of testcases.)

## v6.0

It's the first version after the versioning rules changed, so there's no change log before v6.0.
