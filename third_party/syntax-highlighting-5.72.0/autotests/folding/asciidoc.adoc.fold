Testing the syntax highlighting support in KDE Frameworks.

The first of the following sections lists the things that are known not to work.
Further sections are intended for testing the supported features of AsciiDoc.


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'></beginfold id='1'>= Known Not to Work

There are a couple of things that are known not to work.


<beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Block

* Highlighting of attributes inside a block title.

* Highlighting of formatted text inside a block title other than ...
** #marked#
** `monospaced`

* Code folding for contiguous blocks.
+
This has an advantage too, though.
It enables the user to decide on having code folding or not.
For short blocks without empty lines where no code folding is desired, use contiguous blocks.
For longer blocks which should support code folding, use delimited blocks.

* Multiple lines of meta data.
+
.For delimited blocks, Asciidoctor supports something like this:
<beginfold id='3'>-----</beginfold id='3'>
[source]
[, options="nowrap"]
----
puts 'hello'
----
<endfold id='3'>-----</endfold id='3'>
+
Syntax highlighting does not recognize the additional meta data lines and will rather interpret this as a contiguous block.

* https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#discrete-headings[Discrete headings]  inside block.
+
<beginfold id='3'>-----</beginfold id='3'>
****
Some text.

[discrete]
=== Discrete Heading

Some more text.
****
<endfold id='3'>-----</endfold id='3'>
+
Syntax highlighting does not recognize discrete headings inside a block.
If a normal section title is marked as being discrete, highlighting works.


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Custom Styles

* Highlighting of formatted text within the phrase to be styled.
+
  Some [big]#big and *strong*# text.

* Highlighting of styles with a phrase that spans multiple lines.
+
<beginfold id='3'>----</beginfold id='3'>
[big]#this
is
not
highlighted#
<endfold id='3'>----</endfold id='3'>


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Formatted/Quoted Text

* Highlighting of formatted/quoted text (e.g. monospaced) that spans multiple lines.

* Highlighting combinations besides those of emphasized, strong and monospaced.
** Attributes inside other formatting.
+
  `{attribute-id} inside monospaced`

** Passthrough inside other formatting.
+
  `+passthrough+ inside monospaced`

** Marked text inside other formatting.
+
  `#marked# inside monospaced`

** Subscript inside other formatting.
+
  `~sub~script inside monospaced`

** Superscript inside other formatting.
+
  `^super^script inside monospaced`

And even more complex combinations.


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>List

* Inside a list, indented lines without leading asterisks or hyphen start highlighting for a verbatim paragraph.
Asciidoctor renders this as normal text.


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Macro

* Highlighting of macros with a text argument that spans multiple lines.
+
<beginfold id='3'>----</beginfold id='3'>
xref:id[this works just fine]

xref:id[
highlighting a macro with
a text that spans multiples
does not work
]
<endfold id='3'>----</endfold id='3'>


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Quote, Verse

* Highlighting for single quote symbol `"`.
+
Highlighting for air quotes `""` is supported.

* Highlighting for Markdown style quotes.


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Replacement

Highlighting for replacements is limited to those listed in the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#replacements[Asciidoctor Manual] and numerical character references.

Highlighting for other https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references[HTML/XML character references] is not supported.

.Examples of supported references
* `+(C)+` resulting in (C)
* `+=>+` resulting in =>
* `+&#188;+` resulting in &#188;

.Examples of references that are not supported
* `+&frac14;+` resulting in &frac14;
* `+&phi;+` resulting in &phi;


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Section

* Setext style for section titles.
+
Only Atx style is supported.
+
NOTE: Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[recommended practices] states _not_ to use Setext style for section titles.

* Highlighting of formatted/quoted text inside section title other than ...
** #marked#
** `monospaced`


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Table

* Highlighting of tables with custom separator.
** The custom separator will _not_ be highlighted.
** All `|` inside the table _will be falsly_ highlighted.

* Highlighting of delimiter-separated tables.
** Table delimiters in shorthand notation and the value separator will _not_ be highlighted.
** All `|` inside the table _will be falsly_ highlighted.

* Applying styles on table contents.
+
When defining a table, individual columns or cells can be defined to be highlighted *strong* etc..
Corresponding highlighting of these cells does not work.

<beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Simple Format

NOTE: A simple note.

<beginfold id='2'>////</beginfold id='2'>
FIXME: In the paragraph below is no note as it is started in the middle of the paragraph.
This is problematic as we would need to know that the note line is not the first line in the paragraph.
<endfold id='2'>////</endfold id='2'>
Some text.
NOTE: This is not a separate note as it is part of the paragraph started with the line above.

NOTE:This is not a note as there is no space after the `:`.

  NOTE: This is not a note as it is indented.

NOTE : This is not a note as there are spaces between `NOTE` and `:`.

NOTE:
This is not a note as it is not using block format and the text is not starting on the same line as the label.

NOTE: This is a lengthy note in simple format.
Second line.
One more line.
And another one.
This is the last line.

This line is not part of the simple note anymore.

CAUTION: This is a CAUTION.

IMPORTANT: This is IMPORTANT.

TIP: This is a TIP. +
This second line is rendered as a line on its own because of the trailing `+` in the first line.

WARNING: This is a WARNING.


<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Block Format

.Contiguous
[NOTE]
[[contiguous-note-id]]
This is a contiguous *note* block.
Second line.

This is the final line.

This line is not part of the contiguous note block anymore.

.Delimited
[NOTE]
[[delimited-note-id]]
<beginfold id='3'>====</beginfold id='3'>
This is a *note* in block format.
As a block, the note may have a title
// comment inside block

In block format, multiple lines, paragraphs etc. are possible.
<endfold id='3'>====</endfold id='3'>

There is no delimited admonition block without block name.
Using `====` delimiter without a block name results in an example block.

.Using open block
[NOTE]
<beginfold id='3'>--</beginfold id='3'>

Asciidoctor seems to just pass through the anchor when escaping it.

The first reference has no label, so its id <<ref-1>> is rendered.

The second reference has number <<r2>> as label.

A reference definition inside the text instead of the bibliography section yields some strange result: [[[ref-o,outside bibliography]]]].
Not sure what to do with this.

This is trying to use the escaped reference <<r4>>.

This is trying to use reference <<r6>>.

<beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>Use and Render

.Start with 1 and render value

.Start with 3 and render value

<endfold id='1'></endfold id='1'><beginfold id='1'>== </beginfold id='1'>About using Spaces

CAUTION: If you leave spaces after the `:` or before the closing `}`, Asciidoctor will make them part of the counter attribute name. +
So it's probably wise to avoid spaces here.

.Define a counter
New value is {counter:c5}.

.This is actually a new counter
New value is {counter: c5}.

.But you can't access that attribute
Can't just show the current value { c5}

.Only if we increment it
Incremented value is {counter: c5}.

.This is again a new counter
New value is {counter:  c5}.

.This is also a new counter
New value is {counter:c5 }.

CAUTION: Similar problems occur when using spaces around starting values. +
*Just don't use spaces*.

.New counter with start value
New value is {counter:c6: 9 }

.But when trying to increment
Incremented value is {counter:c6}
